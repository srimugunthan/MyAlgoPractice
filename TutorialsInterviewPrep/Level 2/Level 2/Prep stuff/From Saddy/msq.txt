Given 2  strings of length m and n ( assume n >= m) 
how to find the longest common substring ? 
-----------------------------------

you are given an array of n numbers and each element is equal to the value of numbers less than that number in right hand side of the original array we have to find the original array 
for ex. if the original array is 4,1,3,2 
     then we would we given the array 3,0,1,0 
and we have to find the original array ,it is given that the numbers in the original array is from 1 to n. 
ex no 2. original array 2,3,1,4 
  given array  1,1,0,0

initially a[1]=1 is the assumption 
after that for any 'i' if a[i]=k , repeatedly fill  
the array with i 'k' times for i=1,2,3,4.... (i.e a[1]=1 so fill the next index with 1, now a[2]=1 fill next index with 2, a[3]=2 ,so add 2 3's and so on.) Now for any number 'x' what will be a[x].

Write a procedure to count the number of bits set in an int. 
---------------

stoneweights{ 
     int stones[n]={.....} //undefined number of stones. 
 
     int totalweight(); //returns total weight  
     int maxweight(); //returns max stone weight 
     stoneweights add();//adds a stone 
     stoneweights remove();//removes all stones of same weight 
 
} 
 
There is another 'split' function which tells you whether or not the stones can be divided into two subsets of equal weights.  As in, returns either true or false.  
 
Now, using the above 4 functions and the 'split' function you have to specify whether a weight 'k' can be weighed by a subset of the stones array.

Given a array of integers. The array is not sorted and there is no range for the elements of the array.

you want to implement that in a function: int cond(int x, int y, int z); using only ~, !, ^, &, +, |, <<, >> no if statements, or loops or anything else, just those operators, and the function should correctly return y or z based on the value of x. You may use constants, but only 8 bit constants. You can cast all you want. You're not supposed to use extra variables, but in the end, it won't really matter, using vars just makes things cleaner. You should be able to reduce your solution to a single line in the end though that requires no extra vars.  
---------------------------------
you have four balls, and four different colors, as a solution. The user tries to guess the solution. If they guess the right color for the right spot, it counts as a 'hit'. If it's the right color, but the wrong spot, it counts as a psuedo-hit. For example: if the solution is 'RGGB' and the user guesses 'YRGB' they have 2 hits and one pseudo hit. Write a program to, given a solution and a guess, calculate the number of hits and pseudo hits.

You have two sorted integer arrays and the larger array has room for the second. Merge the smaller array into the larger one, in O(n) time and O(1) space. 
any thoughts? 
There is another *cute* solution, which involves going the smaller array and swapping with  its elelments with larger array e's lements that are  larger - and then copy the smaller array at the end of larger.  
int A[n+m]; // larger array. 
int B[m]; // smaller array. 
int ia = n-1; // current index in A. 
int ib = m-1; // current index in B. 
int i; // current index in the result. 
for (i = n+m-1; i >= 0; --i) { 
  if (ib == -1 || (ia >= 0 && A[ia] > B[ib])) 
    A[i] = A[ia--]; 
  else 
    A[i] = B[ib--];

#1.  Given an n X m grid of characters. You are supposed to search for a string with in this maze. The characters in the string need not be alligned in a straight line. They just need to be holding adjusent positiong.  
 
eg 
 
if this is a maze 
 
  a  b  d  e  f 
  r   n  a  j  u 
  g  y  m  r   l 
  e  t   i   y  u 
 
The string namit should return a found(True "2,2 2,3 3,3 4,3 4,2" They hold adjucent positions). 
 
Frame an efficient algorithm for this 
 
 
#2. Given a word of 'n' characters and another word of 'm' characters where n>m. the task is to find if all the characters in the second word exists in the first. Frame an efficient algorithm. 
 
#3. Given a url string "http://bla bla bla/bla bla bla". you need to replace the spaces with the string "2%0". The first string has exactly enough free space towards the end to accomedate the extra characters which may needed while inserting the new string. 
 
eg if the first string is "http\\b n" this string will have 2 spaces extra towards the end so that replacing the space between 'b' and 'n' does not need reallocation of memory for the string. No use of extra memory is allowed. Frame an efficient algorithm for this. 

#3 - The trick is: start from the end. 
Code:void space_to_20(char *p) 
{ 
 char *q; 
 while( *p ){ 
  if( *p++==' ' ) n++; 
 } 
 q = p+n+n;

public:

The tree is constructed such that for any Node *n, if n->left is non-NULL, then n->left->val <= n->val. Similarly, if n->right is non-NULL, then n->right->val > n->val.  
Write the function find(int i), which will look for a Node in the tree whose val field is equal to i. If one such node is found, it should be returned. If none are found, NULL should be returned. If more than one are found, then find will chose one of the equal nodes randomly, with uniform distribution, and return it.  
 
Can you do it with only one pass, and with O(1) memory utilization.

You have 4 GB of numbers on hard disk and you have 1 GB of RAM on your computer.Give an efficient algorithm to sort these numbers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have a read-only array A[1..n] which is populated by numbers from 1..n-1, which implies atleast one repetition. However, there can be more. Find any one repeated number in linear time using constant space. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you're  given an Array with X elements find n largest elements in the array where n<X, without sorting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is an array A[1 to N] with elements ranging from X to X-N+1 ( X>N). Exactly one element is repeating itself twice (occurs twice) and exactly one element is missing. They are randomly placed in the array. Give an algorithm to find X if such an array is given.

Q1:-Given a doubly linked list sorted in ascending 
order, Write a function to create a balanced binary 
search tree by modifying the links. The condition is 
you should not use extra space, and algorithm should 
work in-place. write time complexity and space 
complexity of your algorithm. 
 
Q2:-An array has one element repeated n/2 times, find 
that element. 
 
Q3:-find the median of the two sorted arrays each of 
length n. 
 
Q4:-In a matrix, 
* All rows are in ascending order 
* All columns are in ascending order 
* Each element is unique. 
Write a program to search for a given element in 
the matrix. 
 
Q5:-An array of N elements contains an arbitrary 
permutation of the numbers from X to X+N-1 of which 
one number is missing and another one is repeating. 
Find out X, the missing and repeating numbers. 
 
Q6:-write a funcion which does the same work as the command 'tail'  
      in UNIX/Linux.  
tail is a utility which prints the last 'n' lines of a file which  we can specify. the value n also we can say.   so, i had to take in one file descriptor and the value of n.  and as output, i can return the offset from the beginning of  the file to the point from whic the last n line starts. 
 
Q7:-Reverse the order of words in a sentence.  
  Ex: This_is__a_tree.  
   becomes      tree_a__is_This. 
   _ is a space here and what I want to convey is that number of 
spaces between any two words must be preserved. 
 
 
I have some more Qns from that interview. Pls help me to get answer of these Qns. The only condition is that they required answer with minimum space and time complexity.

 Generate permutations of a given string. Some of the elements of the string might be repeated. Generate only unique permutation.  
i already know a solution but it computes all the permutations and checks if the string is already present. 
can we save on some work, by not computing a string, identical to any of the already computed ones.

Basic algorithm: starting from the least significant bit, turn off set bits until you encounter the first unset bet, which you turn on. 
 
Can anyone think of a more elegant solution?

An array {A1,A2,A3,....,An,B1,B2,......,Bn} is given and we have to rearrange it as {A1,B1,A2,B2......} .give an algo with minimum time and space complexity. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, reverse the order of the elements in the whole list: 
{xn, xn-1, ..., x1} 
 
Then reverse the sublist containing the last k-1 elements, and then also the sublist containing the other n-k+1 elements: 
 
{xk, xk+1, ..., xn, x1, ..., xk-1} 
 
To illustrate rotating a list of n=5 elements so that k=4 is first: 
 
1 2 3 4 5 
reverse list: 
5 4 3 2 1 
break into sublists and reverse: 
5 4    3 2 1 
4 5    1 2 3 
 
Each reversal is clearly O(n) and the swapping requires some small constant amount of storage.

Write a C program to print "Hello World" 2004 times.  
 
The program should fit in an 80x25 page and must not use the letters f,o,w,?, & and | (last three are question mark, ampersand and pipe). 
be declared as well. 
 
int cnt = 2004; 
void (*ar[2])(); 
void recurse() 
{ 
 cnt--; 
 puts("Hello World"); 
 (*ar[cnt && 1])(); 
} 
void stp() 
{ 
} 
int main() 
{ 
 ar[0] = &stp; 
 ar[1] = &recurse; 
 (*ar[cnt && 1])(); 
 return 0; 
} 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would you write a C program, that prints something, without using a semicolon?
void main() 
{ 
    if (printf("Hello World\n")){ 
    } 
}

You are given 2 pointers to two nodes (p1, p2) in a binary search tree1. Devise an algorithm to find the distance between p1 and p2 (i.e. the length of the shortest path between them). 
You may use O(1)2 additional memory and you must not change the structure of the tree. 

Devise an algorithm to the same problem when the tree is ("just") binary (i.e. not a binary search tree).

1 A binary search tree is a binary tree which each node of it has the following properties:  
(-) For every nodes y in left subtree of x, key[y] < key[x]  
(-) For every nodes y in right subtree of x, key[y] > key[x] 
2 O(1) additional memory indicates that a constant amount of additional memory can be used (e.g. memory consumption that is dependent on the size of the tree (or on the distance between the pointers) is not legal).
